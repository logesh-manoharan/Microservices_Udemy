History:

	Microservices are introduced to overcome the problems faced in 2 different architectures...
		i.  Monolith
		ii. SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)
		
	
	MONOLITH Architecture:
		Original Architecture
		
		All the software components are executes as Single Process.
			-> Thread
			-> Memory Resource
			-> Compute Power
		
		Strong Coupling
		Implemented as SILO (Standalone Apps). It will not export anything. Nothing can Go Out.
